    "_(BONUS)_. The \"one-standard-error rule\" states that if there are several models with similar estimates of test MSE, we can choose between them by: (a) calculating the MSE standard error model (number of predictors), (b) consider all models with an MSE within one standard error of the model with the smallest MSE, and (c) from the models within this band, select the one with the smallest number of predictors. Perform computations over `cv_error` to select the ideal number of predictors, in accordance with the \"one-standard-error rule\"."
