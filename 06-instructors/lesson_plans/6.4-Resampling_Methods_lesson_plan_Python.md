| 8 mins   | Go through the validation set approach of the slides. | -   The validation set approach<br> -   Drawbacks to this approach |
| 15 mins  | Go through "The Validation Set Approach" section in the Jupyter Notebook file as a class. | -   Use the validation set approach for a linear model      |
| 5 mins   | Go through the leave-one-out cross-validation section of the slides. | -   Leave-one-out CV<br> -   How is it better than the set approach |
| 20 mins  | Go through the leave-one-out cross-validation section in the Jupyter Notebook file as a class. | -   Use `cross_validate()` to perform LOOCV for a linear model.<br> -   Use `cv_error` to choose the best degree of polynomial to fit to the data |
| 8 mins   | Go through the k-fold cross-validation section of the slides. | -   K-fold CV<br> -   LOOCV vs k-fold CV                      |
| 15 mins  | Go through the k-fold cross-validation section in the Jupyter Notebook file as a class. | -   Use `cv_error` to choose the best degree of polynomial to fit to the data using k-fold CV |
| 8 mins   | Go through the bootstrap section of the slides.    | -   The bootstrap                                              |
| 15 mins  | Go through the bootstrap section in the Jupyter Notebook file as a class. | -   Use `boot_SE()` to find the SE of the mean of a data frame<br> -   Use `boot_OLS()` to find the SE of parameters from lm. |
