| 30 mins  | Go through the Simple Linear Regression section of the slide deck. | - Parameter estimation with least squares<br>- Assessing accuracy of parameter estimates<br>- Hypothesis testing for coefficients<br>- Checking quality of model fit with R^2 and RSE |
| 15 mins  | Go through the "Simple Linear Regression" section in the Jupyter Notebook file as a class. | - Use `sm.OLS()` to specify the model and `model.fit()` to fit a linear model to the `Boston` data set.<br>- Interpret results using `summary()`<br>- Plot model |
| 20 mins  | Go through the multiple linear regression section of the slide deck. | - Estimating and assessing fit of parameters and model<br>- Types of errors associated with predictions<br>- Prediction intervals |
| 10 mins  | Go through the "Multiple Linear Regression" section in the Jupyter Notebook file as a class. | - Use `ModelSpec()` to fit a multiple linear regression<br>- Interpret model results.<br>- Use `get_prediction()` to find a prediction interval |
| 15 mins  | Go through the "Qualitative Predictors" section of the slide deck. | - Qualitative predictors<br>- Dummy variables<br>- Two or more levels |
| 8 mins   | Go through the "Qualitative Predictors" section in the Jupyter Notebook file as a class. | - Use a qualitative predictor<br>- Interpret the coefficient estimates |
| 10 mins  | Go through the linear model extensions section of the slide deck. | - Removing the additive assumption<br>- Interaction effect<br>- Hierarchical principal |
| 5 mins   | Go through the "Interaction Term" section in the Jupyter Notebook file as a class. | - Use `ModelSpec()` and `model.fit()` with an interaction term |
| 30 mins  | Go through the remaining sections of the slide deck. | - Non-linear response-predictor relationship<br>- Correlation of error terms<br>- Non-constant variance of error terms<br>- Outliers<br>- High-leverage points |
| 20 mins  | Go through the "Helpful Plots" section in the Jupyter Notebook file as a class. Students should be given time to finish the question at the end. | - How to use plots to examine data and fit<br>- Plot studentized residuals<br>- Cumulative exercise |
