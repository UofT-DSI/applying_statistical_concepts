    "As before, questions that require identification and/or interpretation will not penalized for brevity of response: if a question can be answered with 'yes/no', or a numeric value, you may simply state as much. If you incorporate code from the internet (which is not required and generally not advisable), please cite the source within your code (providing a URL is sufficient).\n",
